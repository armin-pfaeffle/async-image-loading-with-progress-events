# AsyncImageLoadingWithProgress

Demonstration for loading an image via AJAX and showing the download progress, including caching loaded images in IndexedDB.

---

This script is a lil' bit more than a proof of concept. It is written in pure JavaScript, but I will extend it soon, so it will work with jQuery.


## Supported Browsers

The script works with Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge and IE10+. Some mobile browsers do not save the image in the IndexedDB because of lack of support.
